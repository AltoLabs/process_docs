Development Environment Setup
-----------------------------

### Install Homebrew

Install Homebrew using the instructions at http://brew.sh.

### Install Bash Completion From Homebrew (Optional)

Installing bash completion will enable many more tab-completions for commands within bash.

```bash
$ brew install bash-completion
```

### Install Git From Homebrew (Optional)

OS X ships with a recent version of git. However, installing git via Homebrew will enable tab completion of git commands and branch names.

```bash
$ brew install git
```
